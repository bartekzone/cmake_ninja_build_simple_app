## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed:

- **GCC (MinGW-w64)** â†’ the compiler  
- **CMake** â†’ the build system generator  
- **Ninja** (optional but recommended) â†’ fast build tool  

### Check installed tools and versions
Open your terminal (MSYS2 / cmd) and run commands: (If the commands return version numbers, the tools are installed correctly)
- gcc --version
- cmake --version
- ninja --version

If no please run MSYS2 MINGW64 terminal and run:
   
   _pacman -Syu_
   
   _pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake_
   
   _pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make_

To install Ninja fast build tool please run:

   _pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja_

## 2. Clone the Project

Download this repository from GitHub:

   _git clone https://github.com/bartekzone/build_simple_app_cmake.git_

Please check project tree and analyze comments in CMakeLists.txt file
<pre lang="markdown"> <code> ``` 
/project
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ main.c
â””â”€â”€ hello/
    â”œâ”€â”€ hello.c
    â””â”€â”€ hello.h
``` </code> </pre>

## 3. Configure and Build

First, navigate to the project folder (the one containing CMakeLists.txt):

   _cd reponame_

**Option A**: Configure and Build with Ninja tool

   _cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build build_

Explanation:

cmake -G Ninja â†’ select Ninja as the build generator

-S . â†’ source directory = current folder

-B build â†’ build output in the build/ folder

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release â†’ optimize for release (faster binary)

cmake --build build â†’ compile and link the program


**Option B**: Configure and Build with MinGW Makefiles:

   _cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release_

   _cmake --build build_

Explanation:
Same as above, but instead of Ninja, CMake generates a Makefile
The build will be executed using mingw32-make under the hood

---

## 4. Run the Program
After successful compilation, the program will be located in the build/ folder. Type command:
   
   _./build/main.exe_

---

## 5. Clean the Build
To remove all generated build files, simply delete the build/ folder:

   _rm -rf build_
